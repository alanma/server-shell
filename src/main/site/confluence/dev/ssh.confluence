h1. SSH configuration

Following command will produce a file called mycert.pem which will contain both the private key and the public certificate based on it. The certificate will be valid for 1095=3*365 days, and the key (thanks to the -nodes option) is unencrypted:


{code}
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout hostkey.pem
{code}


You can use generated file as a hostkey file.
Open alf.properties file and adjust sshd.hostkey property:


{code}
sshd.hostkey=hostkey.pem
{code}


If you want public certificate to be placed in the same file you can generate .pem file like this:

{code}
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem
{code}


If ssh complains that you already have host key in known_hosts file disable strict host key check in your ~/.ssh/config or delete coresponding key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts:

{code}
Host localhost
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
   UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
{code}




h1. How to see key fingerprint


{code}
ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
{code}
